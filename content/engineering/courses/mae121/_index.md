#  Instrumentation 

### Course Overview

Instrumentation requires a lecture and lab component. The course meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:30 am-12:45 pm. 

Labs are to be emailed as pdf files to Professor Hosannah. The group project will have two components- the report, and a powerpoint presentation given by the group during the online lecture.

- Lab 1: Oscilloscope Lab (Completed)
- Lab 2: Acceleration due to gravity (Phet)
- Lab 3: Response of 1st and 2nd order systems (Multisim)
- Lab 4: Photoelectric Effect (Phet) 
- Lab 5: Flow Measurement (Phet)
- Lab 6: Temperature Measurement (Oven Experiment)
- Group Project (Online Research)

**Lecture Meetings**

Moving forward, the lecture hour will include powerpoint lectures via the Blackboard Collaborate Ultra medium, with lecture files and accompanying materials to be made available on blackboard. 


**Lab Meetings**

Physical labs will be replaced by software simulations. The first hour will involve a tutorial session, and the second will be the practical hour, during which students will apply the tutorial learnings to solve a problem, or perform a section of programming towards their lab assignments/group projects.

**Software Required:**

1. Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome are preferred
2. Microsoft Office (Already have)
3. Multisim (Please see below)
4. Phet Account (Please see below)


### Multisim Circuit Design:

Multisim™ for Education is circuits teaching application software for analog, digital, and power electronics courses and laboratories. Visualize circuits and reinforce theory with simulated instruments, advanced analyses, and thousands of interactive components.

**Access to Multisim Software**
