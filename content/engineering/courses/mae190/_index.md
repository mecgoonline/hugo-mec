# Material Science  

## Course Overview

In the Materials Science course, students perform a variety of realistic virtual tests and analyze results to characterize and understand the mechanical properties of various materials. Students investigate the properties of materials by measuring and comparing the tension, compression, shear, bending, creep and hardness properties of different specimens. They plot stress strain graphs and determine Young's modulus. They conduct a virtual fatigue crack growth test and plot crack growth rate as a function of stress intensity. 

Students use "virtual hands-on" hardware, such as a simulated straining unit to apply force to the specimens. A load cell and meter unit measure the force, while an extensometer indicates the displacement of a specimen.
