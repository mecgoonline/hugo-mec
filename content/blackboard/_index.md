## ConnectCUNY Webex

Blackboard Collaboration didn't work for you? No problem try Webex. CUNY has arranged for Cisco Webex to provide short-term Webex Meeting and Webex Teams licenses to all CUNY students, faculty and staff to help with online learning and meetings during the spring 2020 coronavirus outbreak. 

CUNY has implemented the Webex Education Connector that allows:

- Faculty to launch Webex Meetings as part of scheduled classes or on demand 
- Faculty to use Webex Meetings to provide virtual office hours
- Students to participate in Webex Meetings through Blackboard

## How about Zoom?

Zoom also is a good option for distance learning. The good news during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Zoom is temporarily lifting the 40-minute meeting limit on free Basic accounts. Here are some additional online resources to help you most effectively use Zoom for virtual education:


- [Live Zoom training daily](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360029527911?zcid=1231): These include sessions specifically highlighting Zoom Meetings for Education (Students & Educators), focusing on using Zoom Meetings as your classroom setting. Zoom Webinar training is also available.
- [Recorded Zoom training](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/217214286-Watch-Recorded-Training-Sessions?zcid=1231): Watch previously recorded sessions on demand and at your convenience. Several are in German, Japanese, and Korean, in addition to English.
- Tips for instructors: Check out this [Twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1237491713679060998.html) from USC Ph.D. student and online instructor [Alana Kennedy](https://twitter.com/alanakennedy808) on some of the most useful features and best practices for teaching over Zoom.
