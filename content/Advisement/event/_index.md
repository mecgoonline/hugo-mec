The theme of PI Day Celebration 2021 is The Power of Math.
We’ve invited six experts from both academia and industry to demonstrate the application of math in their fields and to expose our students to possible career paths and opportunities. We will announce the new format for the Math is Everywhere project and the award winners of the Math Competition. Students will also enjoy brain teaser puzzles with Kahoot.
